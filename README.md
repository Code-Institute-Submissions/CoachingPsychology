# Coaching-Psychology
Website for Alison Reardon who works as an executive coach

Project Brief
The project brief was to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using the following technologies HTML, CSS and other frameworks: Bootstrap, Font awesome, Google fonts.

Discovery phase
I discussed with the owner of Coaching Psychology (Alison Reardon) her requirements for a new improved website. Alison currently has a website: www.coaching-psychology.co.uk website.  
<p>Coaching Psychology is a business that has been running for almost 5 years </p>
<p>Alison is looking to expand her business and understand that she needs to improve her online presence to attact more business for her and her associates. </p>
<p>We identified the following 2 keeys issues with the current website:</p>

1) The design is poor and not very attractive or particularly pleasing to the eye.

2) The site is not optimised for use on different size of devices.

The main goal was to build a better and clearner and more attractive looking website which better sells the services that Alison's company has to offer.

We discussed some key user stories which identified the needs of the different users of the website:

<h2>User stories:</h2>
