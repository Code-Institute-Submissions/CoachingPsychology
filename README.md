Project Brief
Build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the following technologies HTML, CSS and other frameworks: Bootstrap, Font awesome, Google fonts.

Discovery phase
I met with the owner of Coaching Psychology (Alison Reardon) and discussed with her requirements for a new website. Alison already has a website here called : www.coaching-psychology.co.uk website which she identified had some issues:

1) The website design is poor and not very attractive

2) The site is not optimised for use on mobile

The Requirement was to develop a better designed and cleaner website which is more responsive website which can be more easily navigated to find out the service that Coaching Psychology can offer.

**User stories: As a customer I want to see what coaching services Coaching Psychology has to offer so I can decide whether to make contact.
