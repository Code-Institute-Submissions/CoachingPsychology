Coaching style:</p>
<p class ="italic"> “My aim is to help you feel some immediate support with your challenges or development areas. To help you develop a toolkit of practical strategies, but also just to give you space to think and work things through. My coaching is a combination of very practical activity (exercises, tools, working through scenarios, planning) and deeper discussions. You can expect to know yourself better and be feeling and doing things differently by the end of the sessions.” </p>
